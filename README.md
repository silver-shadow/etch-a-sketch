Completed the following objectives: 
1. Rather than a simple color change from black to white, each interaction should randomize the square’s RGB value entirely. 
2. Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions.
